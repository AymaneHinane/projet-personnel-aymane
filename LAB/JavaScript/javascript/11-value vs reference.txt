--> Javascript has 5 data types that are passed by value (primitive types):
 Boolean, null, undefined, String, and Number. We’ll call these primitive types.
--> Javascript has 3 data types that are passed by reference (Objects):
   Array, Function, and Object. These are all technically Objects, so we’ll refer to 
   them collectively as Objects.


-->Objects are created at some location in your computer’s memory. When we write 
arr = [], we’ve created an array in memory. What the variable arr receives is the 
address, the location, of that array.
